The submission folder is organized as follows:

The documents in the Past Documentation folder are sorted by their types and versions
The documents in the Final Documentation folder are the final version that we submitted, the pdf is the same as the doc but with a cover page
They are sorted by name alphabetically.
All testing docs in past/final documentation folder acts like a index that links to each individual tests on Google drive
We also have their copies in the Testing doc folder sorted by type of the test please have a look!
We have a folder for all APIs and java docs called API docs

And we have this README, our final report, source code and our poster at the top level.
